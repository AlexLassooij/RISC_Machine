# RISC Machine

As part of an Introduction to Microcomputers course, I was required to design my own Reduced Instruction Set Computer. Using Verilog, I created all necessary components such as the datapath, ALU, Memory etc. I wrote exhaustive unit tests and debugged the machine by analyzing key signals produced by several components. As a result, the machine was able to carry out various ARM instructions and ranked as the 11th most efficient out of 100+ machines.
